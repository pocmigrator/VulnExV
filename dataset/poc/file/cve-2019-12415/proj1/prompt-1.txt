I want you to generate a unit test, using the JUnit testing framework, 
This test is used to verify that the vulnerability was successfully triggered,
You can't have non-existent method calls in the results you give,
Just generate a single test method,
For fuzzy parameters, give specific commonly used types, such as Object,String and so on,
Only the function under test statement is wrapped by a try catch statement(Excluding assert statement), the Exception class uses an exception, and does nothing after the catch,
The code corresponds to the function being tested, with context information, for example: 

The source code of the function under test is (The unit test should test this function):
public static void main ( String [ ] args ) throws Exception { System . out . println ( "file dir waited" ) ; OPCPackage pkg = OPCPackage . open ( args [ 0 ] ) ; XSSFWorkbook wb = new XSSFWorkbook ( pkg ) ; for ( XSSFMap map : wb . getCustomXMLMappings ( ) ) { XSSFExportToXml exporter = new XSSFExportToXml ( map ) ; ByteArrayOutputStream os = new ByteArrayOutputStream ( ) ; exporter . exportToXML ( os , true ) ; String xml = os . toString ( "UTF-8" ) ; System . out . println ( xml ) ; } pkg . close ( ) ; } 

and the class name of the function under test is:
CustomXMLMapping

The vulnerable third-party library function and the class to which the function belongs are:
class name:XSSFExportToXml
method name:exportToXML

The input variable name for this unit test is "input", and the value of this "input" is:
/Users/gaoyi/IdeaProjects/pocdataset/file/cve-2019-12415/poi-examples/CustomXMLMappings.xlsx

the test input data is a filepath, it needs to used to  create a java File, then as the final unit test input

After declaring test input data, you need to call the following statement:
MethodCallInterceptor.interceptor(
org.apache.poi.xssf.extractor.XSSFExportToXml.class,"exportToXML", new Object[]{input}
);

The assert statement to verify that the vulnerability was successfully triggered is fixed as:
assertTrue(MethodCallInterceptor.isTrigger);
