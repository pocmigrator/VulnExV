I want you to generate a unit test, using the JUnit testing framework, 
This test is used to verify that the vulnerability was successfully triggered,
You can't have non-existent method calls in the results you give,
Just generate a single test method,
For fuzzy parameters, give specific commonly used types, such as Object,String and so on,
Only the function under test statement is wrapped by a try catch statement(Excluding assert statement), the Exception class uses an exception, and does nothing after the catch,
The code corresponds to the function being tested, with context information, for example: 

The source code of the function under test is (The unit test should test this function):
public void carregarArquivo ( String caminhoArquivo ) { try { File file = new File ( caminhoArquivo ) ; document = PDDocument . load ( file ) ; } catch ( IOException e ) { e . printStackTrace ( ) ; } } 

and the class name of the function under test is:
Pdf

The vulnerable third-party library function and the class to which the function belongs are:
class name:PDDocument
method name:load

The input variable name for this unit test is "input", and the value of this "input" is:
/Users/gaoyi/IdeaProjects/LLMPocMigration/dataset/poc/file/cve-2021-31812/crash-23adb315cc495bfd4761b16f877639d73d124d5b.pdf

the test input data is a filepath, it needs to used to  create a java File, then as the final unit test input

After declaring test input data, you need to call the following statement:
MethodCallInterceptor.interceptor(
org.apache.pdfbox.pdmodel.PDDocument.class,"load", new Object[]{input}
);

The assert statement to verify that the vulnerability was successfully triggered is fixed as:
assertTrue(MethodCallInterceptor.isTrigger);
