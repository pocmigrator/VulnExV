I want you to generate a unit test, using the JUnit testing framework, 
This test is used to verify that the vulnerability was successfully triggered,
You can't have non-existent method calls in the results you give,
Just generate a single test method,
For fuzzy parameters, give specific commonly used types, such as Object,String and so on,
Only the function under test statement is wrapped by a try catch statement(Excluding assert statement), the Exception class uses an exception, and does nothing after the catch,
The code corresponds to the function being tested, with context information, for example: 

The source code of the function under test is (The unit test should test this function):
public void extractWithZipInputStream ( File zipFile , char [ ] password ) throws IOException { LocalFileHeader localFileHeader ; int readLen ; byte [ ] readBuffer = new byte [ 4096 ] ; InputStream inputStream = new FileInputStream ( zipFile ) ; ZipInputStream zipInputStream = new ZipInputStream ( inputStream , password ) ; while ( ( localFileHeader = zipInputStream . getNextEntry ( ) ) != null ) { File extractedFile = new File ( localFileHeader . getFileName ( ) ) ; OutputStream outputStream = new FileOutputStream ( extractedFile ) ; while ( ( readLen = zipInputStream . read ( readBuffer ) ) != - 1 ) { outputStream . write ( readBuffer , 0 , readLen ) ; } } } 

and the class name of the function under test is:
ZipUtil

The vulnerable third-party library function and the class to which the function belongs are:
class name:ZipInputStream
method name:ZipInputStream

The input variable name for this unit test is "input", and the value of this "input" is:
/Users/gaoyi/IdeaProjects/LLMPocMigration/dataset/poc/file/cve-2022-24615/proj1/crash-a49f954b47e05cc5265db441a64e5d2d55cb33b8

the test input data is a filepath, it needs to used to  create a java File, then as the final unit test input

After declaring test input data, you need to call the following statement:
MethodCallInterceptor.interceptor(
net.lingala.zip4j.io.inputstream.ZipInputStream.class,"ZipInputStream", new Object[]{input}
);

The assert statement to verify that the vulnerability was successfully triggered is fixed as:
assertTrue(MethodCallInterceptor.isTrigger);
