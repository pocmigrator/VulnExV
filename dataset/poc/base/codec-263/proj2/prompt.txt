I want you to generate a unit test, using the JUnit testing framework,
This test is used to verify that the vulnerability was successfully triggered,
You can't have non-existent method calls in the results you give,
Just generate a single test method,
For fuzzy parameters, give specific commonly used types, such as Object,String and so on,
Only the function under test statement is wrapped by a try catch statement(Excluding assert statement), the Exception class uses an exception, and does nothing after the catch,
The code corresponds to the function being tested, with context information, for example:

The source code of the function under test is (The unit test should test this function):
public static String aesDecrypt ( String src , String secretKey , String iv ) { if ( StringUtils . isEmpty ( secretKey ) ) { throw new RuntimeException ( "secretKey is empty" ) ; } try { byte [ ] raw = secretKey . getBytes ( UTF_8 ) ; SecretKeySpec secretKeySpec = new SecretKeySpec ( raw , "AES" ) ; Cipher cipher = Cipher . getInstance ( "AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding" ) ; IvParameterSpec iv1 = new IvParameterSpec ( iv . getBytes ( ) ) ; cipher . init ( Cipher . DECRYPT_MODE , secretKeySpec , iv1 ) ; byte [ ] encrypted1 = Base64 . decodeBase64 ( src ) ; byte [ ] original = cipher . doFinal ( encrypted1 ) ; return new String ( original , UTF_8 ) ; } catch ( BadPaddingException | IllegalBlockSizeException e ) { return src ; } catch ( Exception e ) { throw new RuntimeException ( "decrypt error，please check parameters" , e ) ; } }

and the class name of the function under test is:
CodingUtil

The vulnerable third-party library function and the class to which the function belongs are:
class name:Base64
method name:decodeBase64

The variable name of input data is input, and the test input data for this unit test is:
publishMessage

After declaring test input data, you need to call the following statement:
MethodCallInterceptor.interceptor(
org.apache.commons.codec.binary.Base64.class,"decodeBase64", new Object[]{input}
);

The assert statement to verify that the vulnerability was successfully triggered is fixed as:
assertTrue(MethodCallInterceptor.isTrigger);
