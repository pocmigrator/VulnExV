I want you to generate a unit test, using the JUnit testing framework,
This test is used to verify that the vulnerability was successfully triggered,
You can't have non-existent method calls in the results you give,
Just generate a single test method,
For fuzzy parameters, give specific commonly used types, such as Object,String and so on,
Only the function under test statement is wrapped by a try catch statement(Excluding assert statement), the Exception class uses an exception, and does nothing after the catch,
The code corresponds to the function being tested, with context information, for example:

The source code of the function under test is (The unit test should test this function):
public static < T > T xml2Obj ( File xml , Class < T > clazz ) { return xml2Obj ( xml , clazz , clazz . getSimpleName ( ) ) ; }

and the class name of the function under test is:
XmlUtil

There is a method call chain from the function under test to the function called by the vulnerability code, the list of functions is:
xml2Obj
xml2Obj
Where there is a vulnerability code call function source code is (This function is used to help you understand):
public static < T > T xml2Obj ( String xml , Class < T > clazz , String rootElement ) { XStream xStream = getInstance ( ) ; xStream . processAnnotations ( clazz ) ; xStream . alias ( rootElement , clazz ) ; xStream . ignoreUnknownElements ( ) ; Object object = xStream . fromXML ( xml ) ; return clazz . cast ( object ) ; }

and the class name of this function is:
XmlUtil

The vulnerable third-party library function and the class to which the function belongs are:
class name:XStream
method name:fromXML

The variable name of input data is input, and the test input data for this unit test is:
.../dataset/poc/cve/poc.xml
the test input data is a filepath, it needs to used to  create a java File, then as the final unit test input

After declaring test input data, you need to call the following statement:
MethodCallInterceptor.interceptor(
com.thoughtworks.xstream.XStream.class,"fromXML", new Object[]{input}
);

The assert statement to verify that the vulnerability was successfully triggered is fixed as:
assertTrue(MethodCallInterceptor.isTrigger);
