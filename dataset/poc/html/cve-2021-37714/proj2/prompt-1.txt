I want you to generate a unit test, using the JUnit testing framework, 
This test is used to verify that the vulnerability was successfully triggered,
You can't have non-existent method calls in the results you give,
Just generate a single test method,
For fuzzy parameters, give specific commonly used types, such as Object,String and so on,
Only the function under test statement is wrapped by a try catch statement(Excluding assert statement), the Exception class uses an exception, and does nothing after the catch,
The code corresponds to the function being tested, with context information, for example: 

The source code of the function under test is (The unit test should test this function):
public List < Entity > extract ( File file ) throws IOException { Document document = Jsoup . parse ( file , "UTF-8" ) ; return scrap ( document ) ; } 

and the class name of the function under test is:
Scraper

The vulnerable third-party library function and the class to which the function belongs are:
class name:Jsoup
method name:parse

The input variable name for this unit test is "input", and the value of this "input" is:
/Users/gaoyi/IdeaProjects/LLMPocMigration/dataset/poc/html/cve-2021-37714/1605.html.gz

the test input data is a filepath, it needs to used to create a java File, then as the final unit test input

After declaring test input data, you need to call the following statement:
MethodCallInterceptor.interceptor(
org.jsoup.Jsoup.class,"parse", new Object[]{input}
);

The assert statement to verify that the vulnerability was successfully triggered is fixed as:
assertTrue(MethodCallInterceptor.isTrigger);
